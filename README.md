# Udacity Final Bikeshare Project
 
This is my final project for my Udacity nano degree.
I am learning how to utilize git commands and pushing it all to the github repository.
 
Within this Bike Share python program. I've used different libraries such as numpy, pandas and time.

Some of the fields in the data include:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year

The following questions were answered in the analysis:

Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
(If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
(If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

## Requirements
`Python 3.x` and `Pandas`.
